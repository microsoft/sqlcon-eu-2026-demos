# Output contract

The single source of truth for what a recommendation contains, how it is rendered, and what the skill must verify about its own answer before showing it.

---

## 1. Status vocabulary

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `recommendationStatus` | `provisional` when the skill names one target and one method · `shortlist` when no rule separates the candidates and it refuses to invent one. Neither certifies anything: the skill reads no assessment artefact |
| `confidence` | `low` · `medium` |
| Eligibility, per target | `eligible` · `eligible_with_remediation` · `unsupported` · `excluded_by_preference` · `unknown_requires_assessment` |

**`unsupported` and `excluded_by_preference` are not interchangeable.** A real session marked containers and Arc-enabled SQL MI `unsupported` because they conflicted with the customer's stated preference for managed PaaS. Nothing was technically incompatible. A reader returning to that card in three months would conclude Arc had been ruled out on its merits, when the customer had only expressed a preference — and preferences change, while incompatibilities do not. Use `excluded_by_preference` and name the answer that caused it, so it can be revisited without re-litigating feasibility.

`validated` and `high` are not in this contract. The skill reads no assessment artefact: it opens no report, runs no tool and queries no service, so it cannot certify one. Four self-declared booleans used to promote a recommendation to `validated` and `high`, which turned an unverified statement into an assurance and moved responsibility onto a flag nobody had checked.

Promoting a recommendation to validated means reading real artefacts and recording, for each one, its type, its URI or hash, the tool and version that produced it, its date, the target region and the approver. That belongs to a workflow that can open them.

### Confidence

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `medium` | Triage is complete and internally consistent. The ceiling for this skill |
| `low` | At least one decision-driving unknown remains, or two answers conflict |

### Control plane

`controlPlane` names what orchestrates the migration, and it selects prerequisites rather than
labelling the result: `azure-arc` pulls in the Arc extension, identity and batch requirements and
changes which source-version matrix governs the method.

| Value | Orchestrated by |
|---|---|
| `standalone` | the source and target instances, with no orchestration layer |
| `azure-arc` | SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc |
| `ssms-migration-component` | the SSMS 22 Migration Component |
| `azure-migrate` | Azure Migrate |
| `azure-dms` | Azure Database Migration Service |
| `fabric` | the Fabric Migration Assistant |
| `vmware-hcx` | VMware HCX |

The schema has declared these seven since v3.1 and this page named none of them, so a producer had
to read the schema to learn a vocabulary the contract was supposed to publish.

Markdown is the default rendering. JSON is produced on request. **The card is a faithful rendering of this object**: an example may not introduce a field that does not exist here.

## 3. Self-check, before rendering

Run every invariant below **before** showing the card. This is the only mechanism in the skill that protects a live answer, so it is not optional.

| # | Invariant |
|---|---|
| 1 | The primary target is `eligible` or `eligible_with_remediation`, never one just marked `unsupported` |
| 2 | The alternative target is also `eligible` or `eligible_with_remediation` |
| 3 | The selected method is not `unavailable`: nothing it consumes rules it out. Its gate may be `passed`, or `unknown_requires_assessment` when a field it depends on is unproven, and a recommendation resting on an unproven gate is provisional and says which evidence would settle it |
| 4 | The selected tier violates no capacity or feature limit |
| 5 | Every hard-gate unknown appears in both `unknowns` and `evidenceRequired`. A **hard-gate unknown** is a fact this interview could have collected and did not, so it names a question that was never answered. A prerequisite the interview cannot reach at all is not one: see invariant 5b |
| 5b | A candidate reads `unknown_requires_assessment` for one of two reasons, and they are recorded differently. **A field the profile does not carry** is a hard-gate unknown: it belongs in `unknowns` and `evidenceRequired`, and it lowers confidence, because the interview could have settled it and did not. **A prerequisite path no question in this interview reaches** is not: it belongs in `evidenceRequired` and `nextActions` as work for the prerequisite-plan skill, and it does not lower confidence, because no answer the user could give would change it. That second kind does not lower confidence **even when it holds the selected method**, whose gate invariant 15 then puts at `unknown_requires_assessment` as well: the card states the unsettled path and the next step rather than hiding it behind a lower number. Recording the second kind as an unknown makes `medium` unreachable for every profile, including one that states every field, which turns a documented ceiling into a fiction. Recording it nowhere hides why the candidate is being held |
| 6 | An `unsupported` target never appears as primary or alternative |
| 7 | Refusing a preview **method** never removes a generally available **target** when another viable method exists |
| 8 | No cost figure appears without measured sizing and stated pricing assumptions |
| 9 | `recommendationStatus` is `provisional` or `shortlist`, and `confidence` is at most `medium` |
| 16 | **A shortlist is a state, not a sentence in the target field.** When no rule separates the candidates, `recommendationStatus` is `shortlist`, `recommendation` is absent, and `shortlist[]` names at least two families with why each stands and **what would separate it**. It used to be expressed by putting the phrase `provisional shortlist only` where a target name belongs, which validated because that field accepted any string, so a consumer read something shaped like a target and resolvable as nothing. `recommendation.target` is an enumeration of the eight families now, and a shortlist of one is a recommendation that will not say its own name |
| 10 | **A method gate may not report `passed` while any field it consumes is unknown.** A real session declared native backup/restore `passed` with the Blob upload path unverified. Report `unknown_requires_assessment` and name the evidence instead |
| 11 | Every one of the eight target families appears in the Phase A trace: SQL VM, AVS, SQL MI, SQL DB, Fabric SQL DB, Arc-enabled SQL MI, container, Arc in-place. A family that silently disappears cannot be argued with |
| 12 | `unsupported` marks a technical incompatibility only. A target the user ruled out by preference is `excluded_by_preference`, because a preference can be revisited and an incompatibility cannot |
| 13 | `normalizedProfile` is present, so the reader can see what the skill thinks it was told |
| 14 | **Every method the section 8 matrix marks `primary` or `secondary` for the chosen target appears in `methodCandidates`, with a status and a reason.** This is invariant 11 applied to methods. A method that is never a candidate is never rejected either, so its absence cannot be argued with — which is how Azure DMS stayed out of the Managed Instance and SQL VM guidance while the matrix declared it supported for both |
| 15 | The recommended method appears in `methodCandidates`, and **its status there and its `methodGateTrace` result answer the same question, so they must agree**: `available` with `passed`, `unknown_requires_assessment` with `unknown_requires_assessment`, and never `unavailable` or `refused` for a method that won. The two use different words for the same three states, which is why they drifted apart unnoticed in the shipped exemplars. This invariant used to demand `available` outright, which made the ordinary case unrepresentable: a method that is viable, recommended, and waiting on one unproven field had no honest shape, so the card either claimed a gate it had not passed or dropped the candidate that won |

**When an invariant fails, do not repair the output silently.** Expose the inconsistency, return a provisional shortlist or name the missing evidence, and say which invariant broke. A card that quietly corrects itself hides the fact that the rules disagreed.

**When every invariant passes, show nothing about the check.** The user sees the normal card.

## 4. Markdown rendering

In the user's language.

```markdown
> **Preliminary recommendation — <profile>**
> **<PRIMARY TARGET>** via **<METHOD>** · status **provisional** · confidence **<medium|low>**
> KB **<version>** · rules **<version>** · commit **<sha or n/a>** · evaluated **<timestamp>**

One sentence on why this is the recommended assessment path.

**📋 Primary recommendation**

| | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| 🎯 **Target / tier** | … |
| 🔁 **Migration method** | … |
| 👁️ **Target availability during sync** | read-write · read-only · unavailable · not-present |
| ⏱️ **Business cutover downtime** | near-zero · < 1 minute · minimal · minutes · hours · full restore time · full load time · total migration time · unknown_requires_assessment |
| 🧭 **Assess / orchestrate** | … |
| 💰 **Cost view** | Cost levers only; no estimate until sizing and pricing are done |

🥈 **Alternative** — <target> via <method>; wins when <condition>.

**Phase A eligibility**

- **SQL MI** — `<status>`: `<reason>` `[RULE-ID]`
- **SQL DB** — `<status>`: `<reason>` `[RULE-ID]`
- … one line per relevant target

🔁 **Method gate** — <method>: passed | unknown_requires_assessment (<what is unverified>) | refused (<reason>)

🚧 **Blockers and required evidence**
- **<blocker>** → <remediation or assessment>

**Unknowns** — <unknown> → why it can change the decision

**Assumptions** — …

**Largest risk** — one sentence.

**Next action** — the single assessment to run first.

**Evidence links** — first-party sources used, with preview or limit caveats.
```

### Rule IDs in the trace

Each eligibility line carries the ID of the rule that decided it, in brackets. It is one short token, not a paragraph: enough for a reader to look the rule up in `decision-rules.md` and challenge it.

The full reasoning stays **on request**. The readable card is the default.

## 5. Estate output

For `scope = LARGE_ESTATE`, lead with an estate strategy, then a compact table:

| Profile | Primary | Alternative | Status / confidence | Key evidence gap |

Expand only the non-obvious profiles. The per-database card is for a single profile.

---

## 6. What the output must never do

- Claim a status or confidence outside §1.
- Present a cost estimate. Cost levers only.
- Recommend a retired tool: DMA, the Azure Data Studio migration extension, DMS *classic*, DEA, Distributed Replay. Naming them as history or as something replaced is fine.
- Echo customer names, tenant details, server names or subscription identifiers. Answer using them if supplied, write the card so it can be shared without them.
- Contradict its own eligibility table. That is what §3 exists to prevent.
