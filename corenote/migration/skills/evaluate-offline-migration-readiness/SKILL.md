# Evaluate Offline Migration Readiness

## When to Use

Use directly or from `run-migration-assessment` for local/on-premises readiness
assessment without performance-based SKU sizing. Invoke after the server is
confirmed Local. Route Azure identifiers and unresolved servers through
`run-migration-assessment`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check the Host and Tools

Apply [OS requirements](../references/os-requirements.md), then
[assessment prerequisites](../references/assessment-prerequisites.md), before asking for connection
details or an output folder. Continue on a supported Windows host.

### Step 2: Confirm Inputs

Reuse the instance and output folder from context. If the folder is missing,
present selectable Default (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\SqlAssessment`) and Custom
choices. Wait for the answer and use the selected path.

### Step 3: Check Existing Results

Use `references/command-execution.md` to find the latest result matching the exact
normalized instance name.

- Existing result -> read and render it before asking anything else. Show its
  generation time and run a fresh assessment only after explicit confirmation.
- No result -> continue.

### Step 4: Run Assessment

Reuse complete connection details already present in conversation context.
Do not ask how to connect when the server and credentials were already
provided. Collect only missing connection information using
[local server connection](../references/local-server-connection.md), then run the matching command
from `references/command-execution.md`.

### Step 5: Render

Read the output JSON, then read and render
`references/readiness-output.md`.

This is a hard output contract:

- Use the template exactly; do not replace it with a prose summary.
- Render all three target sections and the report path.
- Render the complete assessment before asking about SKU sizing.
- A retry, successful fresh assessment, or existing result uses the same
  template.
- The user's later SKU-duration choice must not replace or shorten the
  readiness response already required by this step.

### Step 6: Offer SKU Sizing

Immediately after rendering readiness, ask:

> "How long should I collect performance data for a right-sized Azure SQL SKU
> recommendation?"

Present selectable options:

- 2 hours
- 24 hours (Recommended)
- I don't want a SKU recommendation

Allow a custom duration through the free-form answer. Convert the selected
duration to seconds and delegate to `recommend-sku-sizing`. If the user declines,
finish after readiness. Present the duration choices directly after readiness.

## Notes

- Confirm the output folder before checking files.
- Prefer an exact instance-tagged report. If the CLI generates
  `SqlAssessmentReport-*.json` instead, use it only from the confirmed
  per-instance output folder.
- Include the generated report path. Prefer HTML when present; otherwise link
  the JSON report.

## Error Handling

- Cannot connect -> check server name, port, firewall, and credentials.
- Tool or extension unavailable -> follow
  [assessment prerequisites](../references/assessment-prerequisites.md).
