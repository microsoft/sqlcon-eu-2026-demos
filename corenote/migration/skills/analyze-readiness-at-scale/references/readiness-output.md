# Readiness at Scale Fixed Output

Render only the sections in this file and keep their order. Do not add an
estate-summary table, costs, SKU recommendations, target configuration,
database coverage, warning details, recommended actions, or next steps.

```text
SQL Server Migration Assessment at Scale
Scope: <All accessible enabled subscriptions (count) | selected subscription display name (ID)[, ...]>
Generated: <UTC timestamp>
Assessment freshness: uploaded within the last 14 days
```

## 1. Readiness Totals

```text
READINESS TOTALS
```

| Status | SQL DB | SQL MI | SQL VM |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ✅ Ready | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` |
| 🟤❕ Ready with Conditions | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` |
| ❌ Not Ready | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` |
| ❔ Unknown | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` | `<count> (<percent>)` |
| **Total Assessed** | `<count>` | `<count>` | `<count>` |

Use each target's `Total Assessed` as its percentage denominator. The four
status counts must equal `Total Assessed` for that target. Do not rename `Ready
with Conditions` to `Remediable` or `Ready with Warning`.

## 2. Assessed Instance Readiness

Show the first 12 fresh assessed instances by default. Do not include
unassessed, stale, or disabled inventory rows in the default grid.

```text
READINESS GRID — <Query 2 row count> ASSESSED INSTANCES × 3 TARGETS
Page: <current> of <total> | Showing <first row>-<last row> of <Query 2 row count>
```

| SQL Server instance | SQL DB | SQL MI | SQL VM |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<instanceDisplayName>` | `<status>` | `<status>` | `<status>` |

Use only these visual labels:

- `✅ Ready`
- `🟤❕ Ready with Conditions`
- `❌ Not Ready`
- `❔ Unknown`

Never display `1 blocker`, `2 blockers`, or another blocker count in place of a
readiness status. Do not add version, assessed date, target SKU, blockers,
warnings, database readiness, or a separate status column to this grid.

Use the fully paginated Query 2 row count for the grid heading and pagination.
When more than 12 assessed instances match, end with:

```text
Showing <first row>-<last row> of <Query 2 row count>. Ask for the next page or narrow the scope.
```

Rows are ordered by the resource-qualified `instanceDisplayName` for stable
paging.

## 3. Top Five Recorded Blockers

Render one table for SQL DB and one table for SQL MI.
Example -

```text
TOP 5 RECORDED BLOCKERS ACROSS ESTATE — SQL DB
```

| Rank | Blocker | Instances |
|---:|---|---:|
| `1` | `<featureId>` | `<distinct affected instance count> / <Total Assessed>` |

Count each SQL Server instance once per blocker, even when the finding appears in multiple databases or at both server and database level. Count only current `Issue` findings for the table's target.

If no named blockers are returned and both `Ready with Conditions` and
`Not Ready` are zero, write:

```text
No current named Issue blockers were returned for <target>.
```

If no named blockers are returned, `Ready with Conditions` is greater than
zero, and `Not Ready` is zero, do not imply that the target has no assessment
findings. Write:

```text
No current named Issue blockers were returned for <target>. The <count> Ready with Conditions instances have conditional assessment findings; Warning findings are not included in the blocker ranking.
```

If the target has Not Ready instances but no named blockers, report a data gap.

After the SQL DB and SQL MI blocker tables, render:

```text
TOP 5 RECORDED BLOCKERS ACROSS ESTATE — SQL VM

No compatibility blockers apply to SQL Server on Azure VM.
```

## Filter Prompt

End the report with exactly:

```text
You can filter the assessed instances by SQL Server version or edition, or ask for remediation guidance for a listed top blocker.
```
