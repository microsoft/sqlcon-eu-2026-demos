## 3. Export each database

Never connect to either the source or target with SQL login/SQL authentication.
Do not request, accept, retrieve, or use SQL passwords or SQL credentials. Use
only Windows Integrated authentication or Microsoft Entra authentication supported
by the workflow.

For Windows integrated authentication, the session's `sourceConnectionString`
variable (populated during the earlier authentication step, never fabricated
inline) must contain `Integrated Security=True` or `Trusted_Connection=True`. Do
not add `/SourceIntegratedSecurity`; `SqlPackage` 170.4 does not support that
argument. Validate the shared argument pattern before starting the batch and
retain the defensive check in the process wrapper.

```powershell

# database-specific connection so one iteration cannot affect another.

For an `All` selection, preserve the diagnostics, record the failure, and continue
with the next database. For a single-database selection, stop on failure. Include
every skipped database and its failure reason in the final report.

## 4. Import each local BACPAC

Wait until all export attempts finish, then require at least one successful export.
After authentication, set the three SKU values from the SSMS-style database
settings choice. Use the same SKU for every database in the batch. Before approval,
display the eligible database names and BACPAC paths in one table and the target
server, authentication method, service tier, service objective, maximum size, and
no-overwrite behavior in a second table. Do not repeat those values in prose.
Before starting SqlPackage, tell the user that the terminal will show a status line
every 30 seconds and a batch table after each database completes.

Validate each BACPAC only immediately before its import, not as an export gate.
Require the exact manifest path, a plausible nonzero size, and a successful result
from the BACPAC verification/checksum process configured by the operator. If any
artifact check fails, do not launch SqlPackage for that database. Mark its import
`Failed` and `AwaitingManualRemediation`, preserve the artifact and evidence, and
continue only when `SelectionMode` is `All`.

Run the wrapper in a terminal channel that streams output while the process is
active. Do not hide the entire import inside one opaque blocking command whose
output is returned only after completion. If the execution host buffers terminal
output, display or tail the current attempt's
`<database-folder>\attempts\import\<attempt-id>\status.log` at least every 30
seconds and relay its newest line. The status file is deliberately separate from
SqlPackage diagnostics, contains no command arguments or connection strings, and
is updated even when SqlPackage has not written new diagnostics.

Before displaying that approval, execute the injection-safe read-only
[target-database-preflight.sql](target-database-preflight.sql) template against
`master` through the validated Go `sqlcmd` route with the approved target
identity. Render its single `{{DATABASE_NAMES_BASE64}}` placeholder only through
[bacpac-target-preflight.ps1](bacpac-target-preflight.ps1); do not construct an
alternate inline query.

Serialize the target names as a JSON array, encode it as UTF-16LE Base64, and
insert only that restricted Base64 alphabet into the temporary SQL script. Never
concatenate raw names into SQL. Delete the script in a `finally` block. This check
must not universally require `VIEW ANY DATABASE`: an identity that can import a
database is not required to hold server-wide catalog visibility. Use the two
fields in the structured JSON result together to
distinguish exactly three states per requested name:

- **Database exists** — the name is present in the second result set. This is
  authoritative regardless of `can_view_all_databases`, because an identity
  that already has some relationship to that database (for example prior
  ownership) can see its own row even without `VIEW ANY DATABASE`.
- **Database absent** — the name is not present in the second result set and
  `can_view_all_databases = 1`. Absence is only trustworthy when the identity
  can see the full catalog; treat this only as a point-in-time preflight result.
  It does not reserve the name or prove which actor creates the target later.
- **Catalog visibility unavailable** — the name is not present and
  `can_view_all_databases = 0`. Do not treat this as absence. Pause that
  database with `FailureCategory = TargetPreflight` and require the user to
  either grant the approved identity read-only `VIEW ANY DATABASE` (or an
  equivalent least-privileged catalog-visibility grant) or independently
  confirm the name is unused, then resume.

If the query itself fails (connectivity, authentication), stop before approval
rather than assuming absence. Run the same preflight again immediately before
starting the import batch so a stale approval-time result is not reused. The
second call returns a scoped, single-use `FinalImport` receipt. Consume that
receipt directly when constructing the import candidate list; generated import
scripts must not call the preflight a third time. This query is the only basis
for classifying a target as pre-existing and skipped.

Because this workflow permits only `SqlPackage /Action:Import` to mutate the
target, the final preflight cannot reserve a database name. Another actor can
create the target after the receipt is issued and before or during import. A
successful import therefore proves only that SqlPackage completed against the
named target; it does not prove that this workflow created or owns the Azure
resource. Record success as `ImportedSuccessfully`, never as a creation or
ownership assertion.

Every `sqlcmd` preflight is bounded by `SqlcmdTimeoutSeconds`. Use 600 seconds
by default for interactive Entra browser/MFA authentication and 180 seconds for
`ActiveDirectoryDefault`; an explicit positive value overrides either default.
Keep interactive `sqlcmd` attached to the current console and capture the
structured query result with `sqlcmd -o`. Do not redirect its standard handles,
because that can prevent or hide the attended authentication flow. On timeout,
stop the exact process, pause the affected imports, save the checkpoint, and
report the timeout as a target-preflight failure.

If target authentication or this preflight fails, set each otherwise eligible
database to `ResumeState = AwaitingManualRemediation` with
`FailureCategory = Authentication` or `TargetPreflight`, save the sanitized
checkpoint, and report the selected method, sanitized error, diagnostics, and
manual identity/permission/network/MFA or catalog-visibility checks. Do not prompt
for another authentication method, refresh credentials, create a target, restore
an alternate database, or retry in the current execution. Resume only after the
user returns with `authentication remediation complete` or `target remediation
complete` and the same preflight succeeds.

The target preflight implementation is executable source, not embedded
documentation. Dot-source
[bacpac-target-preflight.ps1](bacpac-target-preflight.ps1); it renders and runs
[target-database-preflight.sql](target-database-preflight.sql). Tests execute
those files directly. The following block is orchestration that consumes those

```

`$targetConnectionString` is supplied after authentication and must not contain an
`Initial Catalog`; the loop adds the database name safely. Use the explicit
`set_ConnectionString()` and `get_ConnectionString()` methods because PowerShell
can otherwise dispatch `ConnectionString` through the builder's dictionary
interface and create a nested `ConnectionString` key. Do not add
`/TargetDatabaseName`: `SqlPackage` requires `/TargetConnectionString` to be used
exclusively, and the connection string already contains the target database. Set
`$databaseEdition`, `$databaseServiceObjective`, `$databaseVCore`, and
`$databaseMaximumSizeGB` only from the immutable Phase 4 selection returned by
`Resolve-ApprovedTargetSkuSelection`. Do not use representative objectives or a
default vCore or maximum size. Availability still depends on the target region,
subscription, quota, and capacity, which must be represented by the approved
catalog rather than discovered through a failed import.

During an active import, do not treat `Incorrect syntax near 'EDITION'` in the
latest diagnostics as a terminal error by itself. When the SqlPackage process is
still running and an authoritative target query shows the database is `ONLINE`,
report the message as nonterminal diagnostic-masking/parser output and continue
polling. Terminal classification still depends on the SqlPackage exit code and,
after a nonzero exit, the authoritative target-state inspection below.

For an `All` selection, continue after a failed import and validate only databases
whose import succeeded. A database is `Skipped` only when the pre-import
`sys.databases` query observed it. Every attempted import with a nonzero exit code
remains `Failed`; preserve its diagnostics and inspect whether SqlPackage partially
created the target before retrying.
