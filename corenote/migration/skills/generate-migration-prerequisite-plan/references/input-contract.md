# Input contract — `generate-migration-prerequisite-plan`

> **Schema version:** `1.0`
> **Prerequisite knowledge-base line:** `v1.11`

This contract accepts either the structured result of `recommend-migration-path` or a standalone
target-and-method selection. Both modes normalize into a **method path** from
[`path-catalog.json`](path-catalog.json) plus any **overlays** the route also requires, then collect
only the facts that can change a prerequisite status for that combination.

**One path is not always enough, and assuming it was is what lost prerequisites.** An AVS-hosted
SQL Server needs the method path *and* `P27`: the method path alone describes a generic SQL Server,
and `P27` alone describes a platform nobody migrates to. A physical seed transport such as `P14`
rides alongside the method that actually cuts over. Resolve `selectedMethodPath` and
`appliedOverlays[]` together, and apply the prerequisites of all of them.

## 1. Modes

| Mode | Required input | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `advisor_handoff` | The Advisor JSON object or its recommendation fields | Preserve the Advisor target, tier, method, assumptions, blockers, unknowns, evidence requirements and provenance. Do not re-ask a fact already present. |
| `standalone` | Target and migration method | Resolve the pair to one catalog path, then ask the path's unresolved prerequisite questions. |

If the target/method pair resolves to zero paths, return `unresolved_path`. If it resolves to more
than one path, ask only the catalog's disambiguation question. Never choose a path by guessing.

## 2. Accepted Advisor shapes

The canonical shape is the one `skills/recommend-migration-path/references/output.schema.json`
validates, and it is the only shape the Advisor emits:

- `metadata.knowledgeBaseVersion`, `metadata.decisionRulesVersion`, `metadata.recommendationStatus`,
  `metadata.confidence`;
- `normalizedProfile`, `eligibilityTrace[]`;
- `recommendation.target`, `.tier`, `.method`, `.targetAvailabilityDuringSync`,
  `.businessCutoverDowntime`, `.controlPlane`;
- `alternative`, `methodCandidates[]`, `methodGateTrace`, `blockers`, `unknowns`, `assumptions`,
  `evidenceRequired`, `nextActions`, `evidenceLinks`, `largestRisk`.

A second shape is still accepted for the regression mirror, which reports flat fields:
`primary_target`, `tier`, `method`, `targetAvailabilityDuringSync`,
`businessCutoverDowntime`, `controlPlane`, `methodGateStatus`, `recommendationStatus`,
`confidence`, `eligibility`, `methodCandidates`, `shortlist`, `knowledgeBaseVersion`,
`decisionRulesVersion`, `evaluatedAt` and `sourceCommit`.

**`primary_target` and `recommendation.target` name the same eight families, and both are
enumerated.** They were free strings, which is what let the phrase `provisional shortlist only` sit
in a field typed for a target name. Closing that field on the producing side alone would have left
the value refused where it is written and accepted where it is read, so the vocabulary is shared and
a check compares the two typings rather than only the enumerations they draw on.

**The two shapes are exclusive, not merely alternative.** Both are closed and their required keys
are disjoint, so an object is the canonical shape or the mirror and never a blend. They used to sit
under `anyOf` with neither one closed, so a mixed object satisfied the public branch while carrying
mirror fields, and a value the public branch would have refused arrived through a key it never
declared.

**Both shapes carry the provenance the plan is obliged to echo.** The plan's
`metadata.sourceAdvisor` requires the knowledge base line, the decision-rules line and the
evaluation date. The mirror declared none of the three, so a handoff that validated on the way in
produced a plan that could not validate on the way out unless someone invented the provenance. A
consumer requirement that no accepted producer shape can satisfy is not a requirement, it is a
trap, and the fix is on the producing side because those facts exist.

**This list is derived from the mirror schema, not written beside it.** It used to name `unknowns`,
`hardBlockers` and `evidenceRequired`, which the mirror declares nowhere and never emits, so a
producer following the page sent three fields the consumer could not read. The check that guards
this ran in one direction only, from the schema to the prose, which is why prose naming a field
that does not exist went unnoticed.

**`primary_target` is the only accepted spelling.** This page also advertised `primaryTarget`
while the schema defined and required the snake_case form alone, so a producer following the
camelCase reading failed validation before its path was ever resolved. One canonical spelling is
cheaper than a normalization layer that has to be kept in step with both sides.

**A `recommendation.primary` wrapper is not one of them.** It was advertised here while the schema
required `recommendation.target`, so a producer following this page emitted an object its own
schema rejected. If an input carries `recommendation.primary`, treat it as a stale producer, read
the fields underneath it, and say that the shape was out of date rather than failing silently.

**A shortlist is not a handoff.** The Advisor emits `recommendationStatus: shortlist` when no rule
separates the candidates, and that output carries no chosen target: nothing to resolve to a catalog
path. Both accepted shapes branch on the status, so an object names a target or carries a
`shortlist[]` and never both — a handoff that declared it had refused to choose while naming the
target it chose was expressible until now. Return `unresolved_path` naming the families the
shortlist carries and what the Advisor said would separate them. Do not pick one, and do not ask the
path questions of a path nobody chose.

**`controlPlane` is a prerequisite selector, not a label.** `azure-arc` pulls in the Arc extension,identity and batch requirements and changes which source-version matrix governs the method —
standalone Log Replay Service is documented for SQL Server 2008-2022 while the Arc path lists 2025.
It is required by both accepted shapes, so a handoff cannot arrive without one. This page used to
say that an absent value should be read as `standalone`, which is the defect it was written to
prevent: a route orchestrated by Arc would have been planned as a standalone migration, missing the
extension, identity and batch prerequisites. There is no default. An input with no `controlPlane`
is a contract failure and is reported as one.

**`methodCandidates[]` is the list of methods the Advisor weighed.** When the user prefers a
candidate marked `available` over the recommended one, resolve that candidate's
`prerequisitePaths` instead. Do not re-run the ranking.

**Inherited facts are resolved through [`advisor-fact-mappings.json`](advisor-fact-mappings.json), not by guesswork.**
The two skills name and type their facts differently, so "do not ask again" was impossible to apply
consistently: `size` is a band here and a number in gigabytes there, `downtime` is
`downtime_tolerance`, and `mi_link_ports` is free text against a status. The crosswalk states, for
every field, whether it converts directly, needs a vocabulary translation, or **cannot convert at
all**. The last case is the important one: a qualitative note about performance is not a captured
baseline, and a list of dependencies the user happened to mention is not a completed inventory. For
those fields the question is still asked, and the Advisor's answer may be offered as the default.

Normalize the shapes before applying prerequisite rules. The handoff is a recommendation, not
proof that its assumptions or user-reported evidence were verified.

## 3. Absence and evidence semantics

| Value | Meaning | Prerequisite effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONFIRMED` | A typed answer or an inherited Advisor fact satisfies the requirement, as **stated**. The skill makes no network calls and cannot check the claim against Azure | `confirmed` |
| `MISSING` | A typed answer establishes that the requirement is not met | `missing` |
| `UNKNOWN` | Not assessed, blank, declined, ambiguous or unrecognized | `unknown` |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | The applicability condition is demonstrably false | `not_applicable` |

Never convert free prose such as “network should be fine” into `CONFIRMED`. A confirmation that
requires evidence needs an evidence record containing its type, date, origin and a shareable
reference or hash. A self-declared Advisor evidence flag remains a claim until that record exists.

## 4. Top-level request

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "mode": "advisor_handoff",
  "requestedOutput": "both",
  "language": "en",
  "advisorOutput": {
    "primary_target": "Azure SQL Managed Instance",
    "tier": "General Purpose",
    "method": "MI Link",
    "targetAvailabilityDuringSync": "read-only",
    "businessCutoverDowntime": "<1min",
    "controlPlane": "standalone",
    "methodGateStatus": "passed",
    "recommendationStatus": "provisional",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "knowledgeBaseVersion": "v3.13",
    "decisionRulesVersion": "v3.13",
    "evaluatedAt": "2026-09-12T09:00:00Z"
  },
  "standaloneSelection": null,
  "knownFacts": {},
  "evidence": []
}
```

`requestedOutput` is `markdown`, `json`, or `both`. Markdown and JSON render the same normalized
decision state; neither format may add an inference missing from the other.

`knownFacts` is keyed by question id, and every value is checked against the vocabulary or the type
that question accepts. The mapping is derived from `questions.json`, not written twice: an
enumerated question types as its own values, a count as an integer of at least one, a size as a
number of at least zero, and everything else as a string with something in it. Unrecognised fields
are refused outright.

It used to be one open union of the readiness enum, any non-empty string, any number, any integer,
a boolean and any object. `tde_status: true`, `database_count: -5` and
`mi_link_ports_status: "BANANA"` all validated, and a value that validates is a typed fact, so any
of them could confirm a prerequisite and clear a blocker on its way to a go decision.

**Omitting a key and answering `UNKNOWN` are different statements.** Absence means the question was
never asked; `UNKNOWN` means it was asked and not answered. Every enumerated field carries an
`UNKNOWN` value so the two stay distinguishable, and a check refuses any that does not.

## 5. Canonical facts

The authoritative field-to-path mapping is in `path-catalog.json`. Ask a field only when it is
listed in `commonQuestionFields` or the selected path's `questionFields`, is not already answered,
and can still change at least one applicable prerequisite.

**Disambiguation exception.** A field named in a path's `disambiguation` block is askable even
before a path is selected, because it exists to choose between candidate paths. `ha_migration_pattern`
(P01 vs P02) and `arc_restore_entrypoint` (P17 vs P18) are askable only through this exception;
neither field is listed in `commonQuestionFields` or in any path's `questionFields`. `bulk_copy_tool`,
`dms_migration_mode` and `azure_migrate_intent` need no exception because their disambiguation field
is already inside the `questionFields` of the paths they distinguish.

`azure_migrate_intent` exists because `Azure Migrate` on its own names two different pieces of work:
the assessment that discovers an estate (P28) and the replication that moves a machine (P06). Both
paths answer to the bare name and both can apply to a SQL Server on Azure VM, so without the field
the catalog resolves one of them by accident. Assessment prerequisites are not replication
prerequisites, and a reader handed the wrong set finds out at cutover.

Question definitions, accepted values, consumers and distinct status effects are machine-readable in
[`questions.json`](questions.json). A question absent from that file must not be asked.

## 6. Evidence records

```json
{
  "id": "EV-001",
  "type": "connectivity_test",
  "status": "verified",
  "collectedAt": "2026-08-13T10:00:00Z",
  "origin": "customer-run preflight",
  "tool": "Test-NetConnection",
  "toolVersion": null,
  "reference": "sha256:…",
  "supports": ["P08-004"]
}
```

`status` is `reported` or `verified`. Only `verified` can confirm an evidence-gated prerequisite.
Never include credentials, connection strings, secrets, certificate private keys, customer names,
server names, tenant IDs or subscription IDs in the generated plan.

## 7. Asking rules

- Use `ask_user`; ask one compact question at a time.
- Never use a multi-select. Use a single choice, typed number, or short structured text.
- Ask each field at most once. A declined, blank or ambiguous answer becomes `UNKNOWN`.
- Ask in the user's language; store canonical values.
- Do not ask for a fact inherited from the Advisor unless the two supplied values conflict.
- When values conflict, show both values and mark the field `UNKNOWN`; do not silently choose one.
- Stop asking when remaining answers cannot change an applicable prerequisite status.

## 8. Out of scope

This contract does not authorize provisioning, configuration changes, migration execution,
remediation, credential collection, target selection or architecture approval.
